## Project Setup & Start Guide

This guide explains how to start both the server and the client of the project so it can be ready for use.

### Fist: Installation and start the server side:

1. Install dependencies for the REST-API server:

    Open Terminal, navigate and install:
    - cd REST-API
    - npm i (install)

2. Start the REST-API server:
    - npm run dev

If everything is normal you will see the following messages:

    Connected to the database!
    Server is listening on http://localhost:3000
    

### Second: Installation and start the client side:

1. Install dependencies for the client (SPA):

    Open Terminal, navigate and install:
   
        - cd project-app
        - npm i (install)

3. Start the Application:
    - npx(if needed) ng serve

The SPA will be available at http://localhost:4200

Ensure the REST API server is running before starting the SPA to enable proper integration.# SoftUni-Angular-Exam
